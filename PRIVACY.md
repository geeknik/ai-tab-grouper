# Privacy Policy for AI Tab Grouper

Last updated: 18 September 2024

## Introduction

AI Tab Grouper is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## Information Collection and Use

AI Tab Grouper operates entirely within your browser and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers. The extension processes the following data locally on your device:

1. Tab URLs and titles: Used for grouping related tabs
2. TF-IDF, BM25, and Keyphrase Extraction model data: Stored locally to maintain grouping intelligence across browser sessions

This information is used solely for the purpose of grouping your tabs and is never transmitted off your device.

## Data Storage

The extension uses Chrome's local storage API to save:

1. User preferences (e.g., similarity threshold, grouping interval)
2. TF-IDF model data

This data is stored locally on your device and is not accessible to other extensions or websites.

## Data Security

Since all data processing occurs locally within your browser, the risk of unauthorized access to your data is minimized. However, we recommend keeping your browser and extensions up to date to ensure the best security.

## Third-Party Access

AI Tab Grouper does not share any information with third parties. All operations are performed locally within your browser.

## User Rights

As all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your data. You can clear the extension's stored data at any time through Chrome's extension management interface.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
